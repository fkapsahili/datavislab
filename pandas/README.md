(Students already had an introduction to pandas by Andreas Weiler.)

## Practical
Practice further data handling, visualizations using [data from the video lecture](https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks).

### Data Acquisition
- Make the project directory on my own computer: `mkdir <my_datavis_project_directory>`
- Change into the directory: `cd <my_datavis_project_directory>`
- Clone the repository from the above video lecture: `git clone https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks.git`

### Data Handling and Visualization
- Change into the directory containing the sales data: `cd SalesAnalysis/Sales_Data`
- Start Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
