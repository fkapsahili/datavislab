## Lecture
Study "[Solving real world data science tasks with Python Pandas!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMOA1pPVUc4)" by Keith Galli.
(Students already had an introduction to pandas by Andreas Weiler.)

Please note:
- There's a table of contents in the description, e.g. to [skip the intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMOA1pPVUc4&t=82s).
- Activate the subtitles
- You can display the video at higher speed (Settings>Playback speed).

## Practical
Practice further data handling, visualizations using [data from the video lecture](https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks).

### Data Acquisition
- Make the project directory on my own computer: `mkdir <my_datavis_project_directory>`
- Change into the directory: `cd <my_datavis_project_directory>`
- Clone the repository from the above video lecture: `git clone https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks.git`

### Data Handling and Visualization
- Change into the directory containing the sales data: `cd SalesAnalysis/Sales_Data`
- Start Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
